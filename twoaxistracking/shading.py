    Parameters
    ----------
    solar_elevation: float
        Solar elevation angle in degrees.
    solar_azimuth: float
        Solar azimuth angle in degrees.
    total_collector_geometry: Shapely Polygon
        Polygon corresponding to the total collector area.
    active_collector_geometry: Shapely Polygon or MultiPolygon
        One or more polygons defining the active collector area.
    L_min: float
        Minimum distance between collectors. Used for selecting possible
        shading collectors.
    tracker_distance: array of floats
        Distances between neighboring trackers and reference tracker.
    relative_azimuth: array of floats
        Relative azimuth between neigboring trackers and reference tracker.
    relative_slope: array of floats
        Slope between neighboring trackers and reference tracker. A positive
        slope means neighboring collector is higher than reference collector.
    slope_azimuth : float
        Direction of normal to slope on horizontal [degrees]. Used to determine
        horizon shading.
    slope_tilt : float
        Tilt of slope relative to horizontal [degrees]. Used to determine
        horizon shading.
    plot: bool, default: True
        Whether to plot the projected shadows and unshaded area.
